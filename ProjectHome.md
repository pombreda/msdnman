From the original article:
"To get the ball rolling, and because we always thought it would be cool, I've written the first one. I call it msdnman, and users of **nix systems should find it fairly familiar: it's written as an analog of the man  command. The idea is to provide command-line access to the MTPS content. I'm a big command-line guy myself, so I really like the concept. "**

The tool looks interesting, but the original links were broken.  Fortunately the Koders website grabbed a copy so I put it back together and put it here.

I have not made any changes to the code from the Koders site, except to modify some using statements that were broken when I added the web references.
